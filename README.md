# Switch Adapted Remote Controlled Car
The Switch Adapted Remote Controlled Car is a colourful cartoon remote controlled car that has been switch adapted so it can be controlled with two 3.5 mm assistive switches. This adaptation is intended for users that have difficulty activating the small buttons on the remote.

To use the Switch Adapted Remote Controlled Car, plug in two assistive switches with 3.5 mm plugs to the two 3.5 mm jacks on the remote. One switch will make the car go forwards and the other will make the car reverse and turn.
